# TrajectoryOptimizationExperiment

This is an experimental project started by David to see if realtime trajectory optimization is a feasible goal for the team to pursue. Most of the initial optimization problem definition for the work here is based on [TrajOptLib](https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Choreo/tree/main/trajoptlib), which is the optimization wrapper for the popular auto software [Choreo](https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Choreo/tree/main).

The primary goal of this work is to determine whether it is technically feasible to run a trajectory optimizer in realtime or near-realtime on top of Oxplorer generated trajectories. This repository only contains code for a basic version of problem definition, solving, and visualization, and therefore does none of the engineering required for integration or application. Students may use this as a starting point for learning about trajectory optimization and can build off of this if they wish to develop it into a full solution. I do not intend to contribute more of a working solution to this repository, but will likely continue work on the problem privately in order to better understand potential pit falls and help provide accurate guidance should a student pick up the project in the future. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions you have about this work.
